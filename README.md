# About me ðŸŒŒ

#### Professional
Front-end developer with a solid background in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a strong focus on pixel-perfect implementationâ€”ensuring designs are translated into code exactly as envisioned. Art and design greatly influence my approach to web development. <br/>

#### Personal
I have a strong passion for art, sports, and logic. These three areas have shaped my approach to both life and work, helping me develop a balance between creativity, discipline, and critical thinking.
